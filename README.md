## About

  1. Naming
  2. Cache Invalidation
  3. Reverse a String Recursively

It seems like lots of tech startups having trouble with strings. Across the nation, startups of all business models and technology platforms are asking their job applicants how to reverse a string recursively or detect a palindrome. What's up with that? You think they would've figured all that stuff out by now!

Anyway, this little web application provides an interface to several common string functions via a little JSON API - for the web developer on-the-go. Enhancements welcome!
